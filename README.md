# Machine Learning - Breast dataset analysis
 The project aims to provide an easy monitoring system to detect the chances of breast care among women.

## Approach

1. Imported the dataset from Kaggle and removed unnecessary columns.
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Treated outliers using the quantile method
4. Observed collinearity and removed redundant features.(maintained 12 features removing others)
5. Created box plots and scatter plots for data visualization.
6. Implemented classification algorithms and noted performance metrics.
7. Performed cross-validation to find the optimum kernel for the Support Vector Classifier.
8. Applied SMOTE sampling for handling imbalanced data.
9. Analyzed the performance metrics report and identified the optimum algorithm.
10. Saved the final model into a pickle file.


## Results

The project achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.
## GUI interface
Created a web page using python flask framework to get user friendly interface .
